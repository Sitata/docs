# Welcome!

Sitata's API is the easiest way to address your traveller's needs in a post-COVID-19 world. Our API will let you:

* Inform your customers about the latest entry requirements for their journey
* Help your travellers understand which local travel and entertainment restrictions are in place
* Update your customers about any potential threat or disruption
* Enroll your travellers in a Sitata Travel Safe Membership
* Embed an insurance and travel assistance offering in your purchase journey
