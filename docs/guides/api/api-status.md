# API Status

![API Monitoring](/img/stats.jpeg)

We keep a close eye on the responsiveness of the API and strive to maintain an [Apdex score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apdex) of 0.85 or higher with a performance objective of 500ms or faster and a tolerable standard of 2s or better.

The operational status of our API can be [viewed here](https://www.sitata-status.com). You can also register for live updates and notifications about downtime on our status website.
